-   ### ✍️ Why do you write blog posts ?

    Writing has helped me consolidate concepts inside my head. As someone who looks for blog posts when
    trying new things I decided it was time to give back to the community !

-   ### 📜 What qualifications do you have ?

    None, experiment with what's written in this blog and see for yourself if things work!

-   ### 🤖 What framework do you use ? Why ?

    I use React and I have never had a very good reason to switch! I love
    using it and the ecosystem built around it.

-   ### 🌍 Where are you from ?

    I'm from Piacenza, Italy.

-   ### 💭 What is your opinion on ... ?

    I am not very opinionated on frameworks or libraries. I think most of them
    have their place in different situations!
    Try things for yourself and see what works best!

-   ### 📖 What can someone expect to find on this blog ?

    I will write mainly about React, Typescript, and the surrounding ecosystem!

-   ### 👨‍💻 What is your preferred tech stack ?

    If I were given full control to choose a stack for a web application I would go
    with React, Typescript, Sass as it's core, then, depending on data requirement I might go with
    Apollo Client, Graphql, Prisma 2 or a more traditional REST backend with Postgres as it's database.

-   ### 💻 What is you development environment ?

    I use Windows 10 as my operative system, VSCode as my editor with the One Dark Pro theme and prettier for
    formatting files.

    I use npm as my package manager and git as my version control system.
