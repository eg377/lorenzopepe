I'm a **fullstack web developer** born and raised in Italy.

I have experience working with the currently trending technologies such as **React**, **Graphql**, **Typescript**, **Node.js**,
but I am not tied to any framework as I have a solid understanding of the fundamentals.

I am an avid internet user before being a developer, that has led me to become very passionate about **User Experience**
with a focus on adhering to industry standards and **accessibility**! Browsing the web should not be a challenge and
should not discriminate people who wish to do so.

Although most of my focus has been on building web applications, I also have experience
building beautiful interactive **data visualizations** using industry standards libraries such as **D3.js** and
blazing fast static websites.
