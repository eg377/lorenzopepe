What better post to inaugurate my blog than explaining how I built it?
In this post I'll explain the build process of creating a static site with next.js.

### Why Next.js ?

While some people may find using React for a **"simple"** static website overkill, I am very vocal on development speed and experience. 
Being that I'm most comfortable using React my focus went to **Gatsby.js** and **Next.js** as they are the clear leaders in this field.

I chose to go with **Next.js** as it looked similar to my normal React workflow but after reading both documentations I'm sure I could have 
achieved the same result using **Gatsby.js**.

```shell
`@@ src/123.tsx @@`
	npm install next dayjs mdx
```
