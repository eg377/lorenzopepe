I'm a **frontend web developer** born and raised in Italy.

I am an avid internet user before being a developer, that has led me to become very passionate about **User Experience**
with a focus on adhering to industry standards and **accessibility**! 

Although most of my focus has been on building web applications, I also have experience in coding beautiful interactive **data visualizations**, 
**creative** websites powered by WebGL and bringing websites to life with **3D** elements.
